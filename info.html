<h2>Our Head Chef</h2>

  We are pleased to have Pablo Arduino as our Head Chef. Hailing from Uruguay, he has accomplished alot in the culinary world. Graduating from IGA at the top of his class at the young age of 18, he has since traveled from Argetina to France and so many places inbetween. His travels has given him a sense of diversity and a flavor profile unmatched. Upon moving to Minnesota he has decided it's time to settle down and calls Ceibo his home.

<h2>Our Reviews</h2>
<ul>
  <li>"Ceibo is a refreshing delight. The first time I came here I was amazed by the friendly staff. However, I was more amazed by the authenticity of the food! It feels like I've traveled straight to Uruguay! If you love international food, you'll love Ceibo"</li>
  <li>"Being from Uruguay myself, I often miss the food and there isn't any place I can go that can match the flavors and style of Ceibo. It feels like my second home! I'm finally able to have a place that can compare to being in Uruguay!"</li>
  <li>"This is the best new resturaunt in the metro! Prices are fair, the atmosphere is beautiful and the food is incredible! Ceibo deserves 5 stars!"</li>
